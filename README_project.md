# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project where I used logistic regression to predict whether a person has diabetes based on their health data.

## What I Learned:
- Supervised learning
- Classification using logistic regression
- Model training, testing, and prediction
- Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib

##Files in this Repo:
- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `diabetes_dataset.csv`: Dataset used
- `diabetes_model.pkl`: Trained model saved

##Try it Yourself!
Use the notebook in Google Colab to test with your own values.
